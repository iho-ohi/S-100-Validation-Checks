# Product-specific checks for S-98 Data Product Interoperability in S-100 Navigation Systems

Documents and materials pertaining to the S-98 ("Interoperability") specification, including cross-product validation.

This directory contains "product-specific" checks prepared by the S-100 Validation Checks sub-group and S-98 sub-group. Handoff and location for subsequent development is TBD. (Update, Dec. 11, 2024: Development of S-98 checks will continue in this repository until further notice.)

The documents in this directory and its sub-directories are development versions. The formally published specification will be made available from the IHO Geospatial Information Registry.

# Product-specific checks for S-129 (Under Keel Clearance Management)

Documents and materials pertaining to the S-129 (Under Keel Clearance Management) Product Specification.

This directory contains "product-specific" checks prepared in the S-100 Validation Checks sub-group from the list supplied by the S-129 Project Team. Handoff and location for subsequent development is TBD.

2024-10-22: Version 0.1.1 of the list has been added. This is an update to the 0.1.0 list from the S-129 PT Chair with the format of "Clause reference" entries corrected by me to be consistent with the current concept for citations:
1) Clause numbers from the same document are inside the same pair of box brackets.
2) If there is only one document mentioned in "Standards document reference", box brackets are not used in the "Clause reference" cell (if there are multiple clauses cited, they continue to be separated by comma+space).

The documents in this directory and its sub-directories are development versions. The formally published specification will be made available from the IHO Geospatial Information Registry.
